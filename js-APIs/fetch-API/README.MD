# Using Fetch API to get data from API

# Introduction to fetch API
* The __Fetch API__ is a __web API__ provided by the browser, so developers can call other public API using it. The browser exposes it by giving out a __fetch__ method that takes multiple parameters. The first is the API you want to call, whereas the second optional parameter is an object that holds all the information you need to make the request successful.

# Using fetch API
* We can use __fetch API__ in two ways: __promise-chaining__ or __async-await__.
