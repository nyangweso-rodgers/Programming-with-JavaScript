# Introduction to `Next.js` 13

- `Next.js` is a `React` Framework that enables:
  1. Server-side rendering (SSR)
  2. Additional server-side functionality
  3. An improved development and deployment toolchain
- You use `React` Components to build user interfaces, and `Next.js` for additional features and optimizations.
- By framework, we mean `Next.js` handles the tooling and configuration needed for `React`, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
- It's significant for web app development because it helps with things like:
  - page routing,
  - server-side rendering, and
  - quick loading times, which are critical for generating a great user experience.

# `Next.js` vs. `create-react-app` Toolchains

- `create-react-app` does not easily help with generating server-side rendered apps.
- `Next.js` comes with speed, and SEO.
