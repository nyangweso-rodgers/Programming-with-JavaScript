# Working with Styles

- all `css` properties can be modified using `JS`. just remember that you cannot use dashes (-) in the property names: these are replaced with camelCase versions where the compound word begins with a capital letter.

  ```js
  var x = document.getElementById("style-demo");
  // change the text color and width of the div elements
  x.style.color = "#649272";
  x.style.width = "100px";
  x.style.backgroundColor = "#33EA73";
  ```
