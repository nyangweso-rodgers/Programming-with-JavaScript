# DOM Manipulation

## Table Of Contents

# Working with Texts

- Three properties for text manipulation:
  1. `textContent`
  2. `innerText`
  3. `innerHTML`

## 1. `textContent`

- `textContent` property gets the inner text of a `HTML` element.

## 2. `innerText`

- `innerText` property works similarly to `textContent` with minor differences.

## 3. `innerHTML`

- While you could only alter texts with `textContent` and `innerText`, you can pass in an entire element into a target element inside the DOM with the `innerHTML` property.
