# Recursive Functions

- **Recursion** is a process of calling itself. A `function` that calls itself is called a **recursive function**.
- A **recursive function** always has a condition that stops the function from calling itself.

- To prevent infinite recursion, you can use `if...else statement` where one branch makes the recursive call, and the other doesn't.
