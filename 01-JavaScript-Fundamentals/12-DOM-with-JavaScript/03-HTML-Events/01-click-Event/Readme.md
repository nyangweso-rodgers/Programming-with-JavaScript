# `click` Event

# Difference Between `submit` and `click` Form Events

- The "`submit`" event is closely tied to the form submission process and is ideal for performing tasks related to form validation, data manipulation before submission, or intercepting the submission process altogether.
- On the other hand, the "`click`" event is more general and can be used for any action triggered by clicking, including clicking submit buttons. However, it's important to note that attaching a "`click`" event handler to a submit button won't necessarily intercept the form submission process unless explicitly programmed to do so.
