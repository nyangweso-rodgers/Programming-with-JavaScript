# How To Set and Run Next.js App

# `Next.js` vs. `create-react-app` Toolchains

- `create-react-app` does not easily help with generating server-side rendered apps.
- `Next.js` comes with speed, and SEO.

# Setup

## Step #1: Run `npx create-next-app@latest <app-name>`

- Run the latest version of `Next.js` by:

  ```sh
      npx create-next-app@latest next.js-test-app
  ```

- Run a specific version of `Next.js` by:

  ```sh
     npx create-next-app@14.1.4 next.js-test-app
  ```

- This step should generate the below **folder Structure**:

  - `node_modules/`
  - `public/`: For static assets to be served
  - `src/app/`: for App router. It has the following files:
    - `src/app/favicon.ico`
    - `src/app/globals.css`
    - `src/app/layout.js`
    - `src/app/page.js`
    - `src/app/page.module.css`
  - `package.json` Project dependencies and scripts
  - `jsconfig.json` Configuration file for JavaScript
  - `.gitignore` Git files and folders to ignore
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `.estlintrc.json` Configuration file for ESLint

- **Remarks**:

  - The `app/` directory in `Next.js` comes with a lot of **features** such as:
    - Layout
    - Routing
    - Fonts usage
    - Loading Component
    - Error Component
    - Not Found Component
    - Template Component
    - Server Component
  - with `Next.js` 13, the file-based routing can be done from the `src/app` folder. Previously, the routing was done from the `pages/` folder instead.
  - To setup pages and routing from the `src/app` folder, we add a setting within the `next.config.js` file as follows:

    ```js
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        appDir: true,
      },
      reactStrictMode: true,
    };

    module.exports = nextConfig;
    ```

## Step #2: Running Development Server

- To confirm everything works, you can view your app by running `npm run dev` inside your terminal and navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser. Then, make a small change to the code and save it.

  ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
  ```

- Remarks:
  - We can change the default port of `Next.js` App from `3000` to any other port by modfying the `package.json` File to add `-p <port_number>` flag. Example:
    ```json
      "scripts": {
      //...
      "dev": "next dev -p 3002",
      "start": "next start -p 3002",
      },
    ```

# Bonus

## Step #3: Deploy Next.js App

- The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Step #4: Set Up Speed Insights

- To start collecting **performance insights**, run the following command
  ```sh
    npm i @vercel/speed-insights
  ```
- Import and use the `<SpeedInsights/>` Next.js component into your app's `layout.js` file.
  ```js
  import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";
  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode,
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>Next.js</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          {children}
          <SpeedInsights />
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```
- Deploy your changes and visit the deployment to collect your first data points. If you don't see data after a 30 seconds, please check for content blockers and try to navigate between pages on your site.

## Step #5: Set Up Web Analytics

- To start counting visitors and page views, follow these steps.
- Step #1: Start by installing `@vercel/analytics` in your existing project.
  ```sh
    npm i @vercel/analytics
  ```
  - The Analytics component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js.
- Step #2: Add the React component

  - Import and use the `<Analytics/>` React component into your app's layout.

    ```js
    import { Trirong } from "next/font/google";
    import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";
    import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";

    const trirong = Trirong({ subsets: ["latin"], weight: ["400"] });

    export const metadata = {
      title: "Create Next App",
      description: "Generated by create next app",
    };

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body className={trirong.className}>
            {children}
            <SpeedInsights />
            <Analytics />
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

- Deploy your changes and visit the deployment to collect your page views.

## Step #6: Adding authentication with `Auth.js`

- `Auth.js` is an open source project created by Vercel. With Auth.js we can integrate many different providers into our applications, giving us the power to use them to log in and out.

## Step #7: Configure `Next.js` to work with Docker

- According to [Next.js documentation](), `Next.js` can automatically create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in `node_modules`.
- To reduce image size we need to add `output: "standalone"` in the `next.config.js` file.
  ```javascript
  //next.config.js
  const config = {
    reactStrictMode: true,
    output: "standalone",
    // ...
  };
  ```
- Add `.dockerignore` file at the root of the project directory to exclude unnecessary files from the **Docker image**.
  ```dockerignore
    .env
    Dockerfile
    .dockerignore
    .next
    .git
    .gitignore
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log
    README.md
  ```
- Create a `Dockerfile` for `Next.js` application:

  ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:18-alpine

    COPY ../package.json ../package-lock.json ./app

    WORKDIR /app

    RUN npm ci

    CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
  ```

  - Here,
    - We are uing the `node:18-alpine` image as a base image. It is a lightweight image that contains `Node.js 18` and `npm`.
    - Using 'clean install' (`npm ci`) instead of 'install' (`npm i`) is a good practice for **Docker images**. It will ensure that the dependencies are installed from the `package-lock.json` file and not from the `node_modules` cache. This is faster than 'install', which is especially important for CI/CD pipelines where you want to keep the build time as short as possible.

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - `docker-component.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications with a single command `docker-compose up`.
    ```yml
    #docker-compose.yml
    version: "3"
    services:
      my-app:
        container_name: next.js-app
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          - 3001: 3001
        environment:
        depends_on:
          - db
        volumes:
          - ./my-app/src/:app/src
          - ./my-app/public:/app/public
      db:
        image: postgres:15.3
        container_name: postgres
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: myapp-db
        volumes:
          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    volumes:
      postgres-data:
    ```
- Run the application by `docker-compose up`
