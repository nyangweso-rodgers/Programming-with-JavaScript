# Introduction to Recursive Functions in JS
* __Recursion__ is a process of calling itself. A __function__ that calls itself is called a __recursive function__. A __recursive function__ always has a condition that stops the function from calling itself. 

* To prevent infinite recursion, you can use __if...else statement__ where one branch makes the recursive call, and the other doesn't.
