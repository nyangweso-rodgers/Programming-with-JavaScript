# Introduction to React
__React__ is a __JavaScript library__ used to build _User Interfaces_. It is developed and maintained by __Facebook__. It is capable of building complex and highly interactive single-page web applications and can be integrated with any backend.

# How does React Work?
* __React__ creates a __VIRTUAL DOM__ in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, __React__ creates a __virtual DOM__ in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

* __React__ only changes what needs to be changed! __React__ finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

# advantages of React
* Very fast, gives smooth experience to users
* Easy to develop and maintain due to its __Components__ based structure. A __component__ basically represent a piece of UI. Once a __component__ is created, it can be used as many times as you wish to.
* can be use on client-side and server-side devices
* reusable components rduce development time and help build complex functionalities
* data is updated by refreshing UI, making it efficient

# CONS OF REACT
* React uses traditional MVC framework and hence requires complex configuration.
* An in depth knowledge is required for integration the UI into MVC framework
* __Redux__ and Routing are external tools that need to be learnt, whereas Angular has most of these tools inbuilt.
