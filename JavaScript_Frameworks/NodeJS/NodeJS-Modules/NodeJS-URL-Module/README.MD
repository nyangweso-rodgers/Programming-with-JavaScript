# Node.js URL Module

# The Built-in URL Module
* The __URL module__ splits up a web address into readable parts.

* To include the URL module, use the __require()__ method:

    ```js
        var url = require('url');
    ```

* Parse an address with the __url.parse()__ method, and it will return a URL object with each part of the address as properties:

    ```js
        // Split a web address into readable parts:
    ```
