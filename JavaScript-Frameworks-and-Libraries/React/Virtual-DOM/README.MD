# Virtual DOM

# Introduction to Virtual DOM
* __Virtual DOM__: uses a strategy that updates the DOM without having to redraw all the webpage elements. Every time the DOM changes, browsers need to recalculate entire layout and then repaint the web page which makes the web app slow. To overcome this, we have __virtual DOM__. Evrey time the state of our application changes, the __virtual DOM__ gets updates instead of the real DOM.

* Whenever the new element is added to the UI, a new __virtual DOM__ associated with that element is created. If state of this element chnages, a second new __virtual DOM__ is created which will be compared with the previous __virtual DOM__. It then updates ONLY the object on the real DOM.
