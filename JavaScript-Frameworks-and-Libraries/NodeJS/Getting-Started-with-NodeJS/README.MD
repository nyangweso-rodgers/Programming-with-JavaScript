# Node.js Get Started

# Download Node.js
* The official Node.js website has installation instructions for Node.js: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Getting Started
* Once you have downloaded and installed __Node.js__ on your computer, let's try to display "Hello World" in a web browser.

* Create a Node.js file named "myfirst.js", and add the following code:

* Save the file on your computer: __C:\Users\Your Name\myfirst.js__

* The code tells the computer to write "Hello World!" if anyone (e.g. a web browser) tries to access your computer on port 8080.

# Initiate the Node.js File
* The file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place.

* Start your command line interface, write node myfirst.js and hit enter:

* Now, your computer works as a server!

* If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!

* Start your internet browser, and type in the address: http://localhost:8080
