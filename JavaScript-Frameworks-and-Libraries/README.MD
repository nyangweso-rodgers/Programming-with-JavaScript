# Library vs. Frameworks
* A __library__ and a __framework__ are similar in that they are both _collections of pre-written code that can be used to add functionality to a software application_. However, there are some key differences between the two:

* A __library__ is a _collection of functions that can be called by the application to perform specific tasks_. The application is responsible for controlling the flow of the program, and the library provides specific functionality that can be used as needed.

* A __framework__, on the other hand, is a more opinionated and prescriptive approach to building applications. A _framework provides a structure and set of conventions for building an application, and the application is built within the constraints and guidelines provided by the framework_. The framework controls the flow of the program and the application provides the specific implementation details.

* In the context of __Angular__ and __React__, __Angular__ is a framework, while React is a library. Angular provides a complete solution for building web applications, including a structure for organizing and building the application, as well as a set of conventions and tools for handling tasks such as state management and server communication. React, on the other hand, provides a set of components and functions that can be used to build a user interface, but it is up to the developer to choose how to handle other aspects of the application.

*  the choice between a library and a framework depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application and the development team. A framework can provide a more structured and opinionated approach to building an application, while a library provides more flexibility and control over the application structure.

# Angular vs React
Parameter | Angular | React
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
Type | Complete framework (everything is inbuilt including Routers, HTTP e.t.c) | __React__ is a JS library and is much older compared to __React__
Use of Libraries | __Angular__ is a complete solution in itself | ___React JS__ can be packaged with other programming libraries. (Since it is just a library it doesn’t have much of inbuilt functionalities)
Learning curve | Learning Angular is not easy for beginners. Thus, it requires lots of training. But it includes most of the concepts and thus you don’t need any external tools | It is easier to grasp compared Angular. However, it is difficult to learn when augmented with Redux. Quick to learn React whereas it takes time to learn external tools such as redux which is essential.
Installation Time | __Angular__ is easy to set up but may lead to an increase in coding time which also results in delayed project deliveries. | __React__ takes longer to set up. But, it is really fast for delivering projects and building apps.
Best Feature | __Angular__ offers a limited amount of freedom and flexibility. | __React__ gives you the freedom to choose the tools, architecture, and libraries, for developing an app.
Data Binding | __Angular__ uses the two-way data binding method. It helps you to ensure that the model state automatically changes when any change is made. | __React__ language uses one-way data binding, which means that the UI elements can’t be changed without updating the corresponding model state.
Testing and Debugging | In ___Angular__, testing and debugging for a complete project is possible with a single tool. | __React__ requires a set of tools to perform different types of testing.
Application Types | You should __Angular__ framework If you want to develop a SPA(Single Page Application) and mobile apps. | Use __React__ if you want to develop Native apps, hybrid apps, or web apps
Language used | __Angular__ uses Typescript which requires a bit of prior learning to be done. | __React__ is written in JavaScript which many programmers are familiar with, hence faster learning
