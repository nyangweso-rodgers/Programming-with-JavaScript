# Drawbacks of React

- With **React**:
  - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
  - Need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
  - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

# Next.js: The React Framework

- `Next.js` is a framework for building **server-side** rendered **React apps**, making it suitable for generating quick and dynamic web applications. It offers the following features:
  - An intuitive [page-based](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) routing system (with support for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes))
  - [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pre-rendering), both [static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#static-generation-recommended) (SSG) and [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#server-side-rendering) (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
  - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  - [Client-side routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing#linking-between-pages) with optimized prefetching
  - Development environment with Fast Refresh support
  - API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
