# JavaScript Libraries

# Library vs. Frameworks

- A **library** and a **framework** are similar in that they are both _collections of pre-written code that can be used to add functionality to a software application_. However, there are some key differences between the two:

- A **library** is a _collection of functions that can be called by the application to perform specific tasks_. The application is responsible for controlling the flow of the program, and the library provides specific functionality that can be used as needed.

- A **framework**, on the other hand, is a more opinionated and prescriptive approach to building applications. A _framework provides a structure and set of conventions for building an application, and the application is built within the constraints and guidelines provided by the framework_. The framework controls the flow of the program and the application provides the specific implementation details.

- In the context of `Angular` and `React`, **Angular** is a framework, while `React` is a library. `Angular` provides a complete solution for building web applications, including a structure for organizing and building the application, as well as a set of conventions and tools for handling tasks such as state management and server communication. `React`, on the other hand, provides a set of components and functions that can be used to build a user interface, but it is up to the developer to choose how to handle other aspects of the application.

|         Type          |                                             Complete framework (everything is inbuilt including Routers, HTTP e.t.c)                                              |                                                                     `ReactJS` is a JS library and is much older compared to `AngularJS`.                                                                      |
|   Use of Libraries    |                                                           `AngularJS` is a complete solution in itself                                                            |                                   `ReactJS` can be packaged with other programming libraries. (Since it is just a library it doesn’t have much of inbuilt functionalities)                                    |
|    Learning curve     | Learning `Angular` is not easy for beginners. Thus, it requires lots of training. But it includes most of the concepts and thus you don’t need any external tools | It is easier to grasp compared `Angular`. However, it is difficult to learn when augmented with `Redux`. Quick to learn React whereas it takes time to learn external tools such as redux which is essential. |
|   Installation Time   |                    `AngularJS` is easy to set up but may lead to an increase in coding time which also results in delayed project deliveries.                     |                                                      `ReactJS` takes longer to set up. But, it is really fast for delivering projects and building apps.                                                      |
|     Best Feature      |                                                  `AngularJS` offers a limited amount of freedom and flexibility.                                                  |                                                   `ReactJS` gives you the freedom to choose the tools, architecture, and libraries, for developing an app.                                                    |
|     Data Binding      |           `AngularJS` uses the two-way data binding method. It helps you to ensure that the model state automatically changes when any change is made.            |                                `ReactJS` language uses one-way data binding, which means that the UI elements can’t be changed without updating the corresponding model state.                                |
| Testing and Debugging |                                    In`AngularJS`, testing and debugging for a complete project is possible with a single tool.                                    |                                                                   `ReactJS` requires a set of tools to perform different types of testing.                                                                    |
|   Application Types   |                              You should `AngularJS` framework If you want to develop a SPA(Single Page Application) and mobile apps.                              |                                                                  Use `ReactJS` if you want to develop Native apps, hybrid apps, or web apps                                                                   |
|     Language used     |                                          `AngularJS` uses Typescript which requires a bit of prior learning to be done.                                           |                                                      `ReactJS` is written in JavaScript which many programmers are familiar with, hence faster learning                                                       |
