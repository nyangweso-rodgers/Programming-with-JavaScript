# Different ways to call API in JavaScript
There are multiple ways to call APIs in JavaScript:
1. __fetch API__:  It is an asynchronous web API that comes with native JavaScript and returns the data in the form of promises.
2. __XMLHttpRequest__: It’s another Web API that lets you communicate with the server via a REST API endpoint to fetch data and then show it to the user without refreshing the page. Despite its name, the __XMLHttpRequest__ API is not limited to XML and works with JSON data too.
3. __Axios__:is an open-source, promise-based HTTP client. It uses JavaScript’s promises to send HTTP requests and manage their responses.
4. __Got__: is a lighter, human-friendly powerful HTTP request library explicitly designed to work with Node.js. It supports pagination, RFC-compliant caching, makes an API request again if it fails, supports cookies out of the box, and more.
5. __node-fetch__: It is a lightweight npm package that lets you use fetch API in Node.js. You can use promise-chaining and async functions to work with it.
